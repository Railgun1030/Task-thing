# Task-thing
yeah, creative name i know.

anyway important things to note:

1) i have not managed to get an exe working of it yet.
2) despite the main project file knowing where it is, and being able to look in the same folder for the json, i don't have any json creation code in it yet, so uhh, make your own json i guess (i did include a test json in the repo, so could use that)
3) the code doesn't like the json have less than 1 task. that'll be something i'll fix sometime within the next 20 years.

i think that's about it. 
oh, opens in terminal, and has all of its commands there behind a help command.
